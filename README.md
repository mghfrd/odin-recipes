# odin-recipes
This project was made based on The Odin Project assignment where I will apply what I've learned from TOP such as HTML, Git, and GitHub.

The project contains simple HTML where I will write 3 kinds of recipes and learn how to link each page of my HTML files together.

## Skills Demonstrated
After completing this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

### HTML
- Writing proper HTML boilerplate
- Using headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to structure content
- Creating paragraphs with `<p>` tags
- Adding images to web pages with `<img>`
- Building unordered lists (`<ul>`) for ingredients
- Building ordered lists (`<ol>`) for cooking steps
- Creating links between pages using `<a>` tags and proper file paths (like `recipes/lasagna.html`)
- Structuring a multi-page website

### Git & GitHub
- Creating a repository on GitHub
- Cloning a repository to my local machine
- Using basic Git commands (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`)
- Writing meaningful commit messages
- Committing changes early and often
- Setting up a `README.md` file
- Publishing a live website using GitHub Pages

### Command Line
- Navigating directories with `cd`
- Creating files and folders using commands like `touch` and `mkdir`
- Checking where I am with `pwd`
- Listing files with `ls`

### Mindset & Habits
- Practicing problem-solving instead of peeking at solutions
- Building projects step by step (iterations)
- Documenting my learning journey

I will recall all the things that I've learned like how to make semantic HTML, using Git and be more familiar with the command line because actually until now sometimes I forget the commands. But well, that's actually okay because I'm still learning. Soon I will get used to it and will be good at it as long as I keep practicing and just believe in myself.
