    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the sate:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams chicken breast</li>
        <li>Sweet soy sauce (kecap manis), to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the peanut sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 shallots</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>5 red curly chilies</li>
        <li>11 bird's eye chilies (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>250 grams peanuts</li>
        <li>500 ml water</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>50 grams palm sugar (gula merah), grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Optional toppings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sliced raw shallots</li>
        <li>Sliced bird's eye chilies</li>
        <li>Lime wedges</li>
        <li>Lontong (rice cakes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Make the peanut sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roughly chop the shallots, garlic, bird's eye chilies, and red curly chilies. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Fry the peanuts in a pan until golden brown. Don't let them burn, just until fragrant and slightly darkened.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped shallots, garlic, and chilies to the same pan with the peanuts. Fry briefly until the vegetables soften and turn fragrant. Then turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Transfer everything into a blender. Add enough water to reach about halfway up the mixture. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the blended mixture back into a pan. Add 500 ml water, salt, and palm sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and is fully cooked. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the sate:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken breast into small, bite-sized cubes.</li>
        <li>Thread the chicken pieces onto bamboo skewers.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with sweet soy sauce (kecap manis) and rub it all over the chicken until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Grill the skewers on a grill pan, charcoal grill, or whatever you have at home. Turn occasionally so they cook evenly and get those beautiful charred bits.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to serve</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spoon some peanut sauce onto a plate. Add a drizzle of sweet soy sauce and mix well.</li>
        <li>Place the grilled satay on top, then flip them around so the sauce coats every piece.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with sliced raw or fried shallots (bawang goreng) and fresh bird's eye chilies if you like it spicy. (Optional)</li>
        <li>Squeeze a little lime juice over everything for that extra fresh kick. (Optional)</li>
        <li><em>Personal recommendation:</em> Eat with warm rice or lontong (rice cakes), and don't forget to sprinkle lots of fried shallots on top.</li>
    </ul>
